### A calculator app with customtkinter

A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division mathematical calculations.

I didn't have any calculator on my Arch Linux and then I created it. I wanted it to be similar to the iPhone calculator, that's exactly what I did.
